ldap2dns (0.5.1-beta) unstable; urgency=low

  * Makefile tweaks to allow for CC to be overridden in the environment.
  * Don't hard-set CC so that the default compiler is used unless it's
    overridden from the environment or the command line.  Also, use $(CC)
    rather than $(LD) for linking because this program doesn't require any
    special linking features.
  * These changes allow, among other things, clang's static analyzer wrapper
    to work properly.
  * Fix logic to set the default timeout.
  * Although the default timeout is correctly initialized, it was overwritten
    with random garbage when the LDAP2DNS_TIMEOUT environment variable
    wasn't set.
  * Update the LDAP2DNS_RECLIMIT logic to be consistent with the handling
    of LDAP2DNS_TIMEOUT.
  * Add help documentation for the "-t" option.
  * Remove a few more unused variables as detected by clang.
  * New version.
