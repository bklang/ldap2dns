Version 0.3.5 - 2005/11/30
+ Added support for DNS SRV records

Version 0.3.3
- Removed a bug which caused ldap2dns to etablish more than one connections
  to the LDAP server.

Version 0.3.2
+ Only patches from Martin Lesser <m-lesser@better-com.de>
  applied. Nothing from myself.
+ connecting to a ldap-server where the server is given as URI works
  (both ldap:// [with TLS] and ldaps://)
+ we use location-codes here, so ldap2dns.c was extended to make use of
  them, this also requires an extension of dns.schema.

Version 0.3.1 
+ ldap2dns now can work together with tinydns. This means that
  all DNS queries are passed through tinydns directly onto the
  LDAP backend. This avoids generating a data-file and calling
  tinydns-data (or restarting BIND).
  Drawback: Queries are much slower now. I am not sure if this
  is acceptable on the long run. This is caused by the LDAP-schema 
  used here, were many objects with strict attribute-value-pair mapping
  is used. Other schemas, such as the core- and cosine-schema need
  less LDAP-objects, since they code multiple values into one attribute.
  Nameservers based on this schema (such as ldapdns 
  http://nimh.org/code/ldapdns/) can therefore answer much faster.

Version 0.3.0 
+ A new interface for web-administration written compleatly in PHP.
  Much easier to install that the old mod_perl interface.

Version 0.2.6
+ Password passed with option -w now is invisible to 'ps'.
+ ldap2tinydns-conf now takes a parameter to specify to user under
  which ldap2dns will be running.

Version 0.2.5
- Tested with OpenLDAP-2.0.
- Adopted dns.schema with official numbers.

Version 0.2.4
- Check for next availabe server in /etc/ldap.conf
  if one is unavialable.
- Schema for DNSzone in dns.schema was corrected.

Version 0.2.3 
- Replaced integer variables for DNSserial, DNSttl etc. by strings
  to allow better default handling by tinydns-data.
- ldap2dns now writes logfiles.

Version 0.2.2
- Tested with djbdns-1.05

- Removed compleatly the possibility to create a binary data.cdb file.
  Reasons:
  * It just takes a few milliseconds to create a data.cdb file with 
    tinydns-data. 
  * Its much safer to have an ASCII data file handy just in case 
    something goes wrong.
  * I am too lazy to adopt ldap2dns for each new version of djbdns.
  * ldap2dns does not have to be linked statically against any other
    package.

- Now the output option takes parameters data and/or db instead
  of numbers.

Version 0.2.1
- Additional attribute in DNSrrset: DNScipaddr
  Canonical IP address, which when used instead
  of DNSipaddr automatically resolves reverse.

- Using Environement Variables LDAP2DNS_UPDATE and
  LDAP2DNS_OUTPUT for default values used by ldap2dns.

- If started as daemon, does not exit if connection to
  LDAP server fails but tries to reconnect after a timeout.

- An external program can be called if ldap2dns detects a
  modification in the database.

Version 0.2.0
- New schema, unfortunately not compatible with old one, but
  now its unambigous.

- Mapping for reverse lookup works fine.

- ldap2dns now can be started by daemontools.

- Fixed a bug for DNSrrset's with type=TXT

- Much better naming scheme for dn's when using
  import.pl

- RPM support
