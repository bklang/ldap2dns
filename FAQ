1) My build bails out with nearly three screens full of error messages!

If the first two lines of that error output look like:

ldap2dns.c:9:18: error: lber.h: No such file or directory
ldap2dns.c:10:18: error: ldap.h: No such file or directory

then you need to make the include files available to the compiler.  Usually that
means that the openldap-devel (openldap2-devel for SuSE) package needs to be
installed.  If you're running on Solaris or have installed OpenLDAP into a
non-standard location then you'll need to modify the Makefile to pass the path
to those header files to the compiler.

2) Where can I find a web interface?

The official web interface of ldap2dns is "Beatnik."  Beatnik is a module for
the Horde framework (http://www.horde.org).  Beatnik is actively developed and
can be considered beta status.  Early adopters are encouraged to checkout
the code from Horde Git repository.
The author uses Beatnik in production today.

See http://www.horde.org for more information.
