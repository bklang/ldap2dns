Make sure you have the OpenLDAP version 2 include files installed.

For Red Hat, this would be the openldap-devel package
for SuSE, this would be the openldap2-devel package

Type "make" in the current directory.  If all goes well follow up with a 
"make install"

To create an RPM, use one of the following commands:

make DISTRIBUTION=redhat rpm
make DISTRIBUTION=suse rpm

if you are running Red Hat or SuSE respectively.

Solaris 8 and later:
Install the Blastwave OpenLDAP package.  For more information on Blastwave see
http://www.blastwave.org

Tested with Blastwave and SFW gcc as well as Sun Studio cc (SUNWspro).
You will also need to use gmake instead of Solaris' make.
This line will compile ldap2dns with SUNWspro and Blastwave OpenLDAP:

gmake CC=/opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc LD=/opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc \
    CFLAGS=-I/opt/csw/include LDFLAGS="-L/opt/csw/lib -R/opt/csw/lib"

Please send any problem or success reports to the maintainer.
