<h1 align="center">LDAP to DNS gateway</h1>
<p style="font-size: 14px"><b>ldap2dns</b> is a program to read DNS (Domain Name Service)
records from an LDAP directory and format them into flat files suitable for TinyDNS (or Bind).</p>
<p><b>ldap2dns</b> reduces all kind of administration overhead: No
more flat file editing, no more zone file editing. After having
installed <b>ldap2dns</b>, the administrator only has to access the
LDAP directory.<br />
Optionally access control can be configured for each zone, GUIs can
be more easily implemented, and add all other kind of zone and resource
record information can be managed without interfering with the DNS server.<br />
<b>ldap2dns</b> is designed to write ASCII data files used by
<a href="http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/tinydns.html"><i>tinydns</i></a> from the <a href="http://cr.yp.to/"><i>djbdns</i></a> package, but also may be used
to write .db-files used by <i>named</i> as found in the <i>BIND</i>
package.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
</noscript>
Often it is desirable to store DNS information in a database rather
than in flat text files. This can greatly help to reduce
administration overhead since associate information such as billing
contact, account management, etc. can be stored and processed
inside the same database. Also due to the nature of DNS,
information must be stored redundantly on two or more hosts. The
classical data replication through zone transfer is unreliable,
insecure and difficult to administer.<br />
To solve this problem some proprietary attempts have been proposed
to store DNS information in relational databases. The nature of
DNS, however, is hierarchical and such should the database be.
Using a relational database to store DNS information is
undesirable, because it becomes difficult to store free form
information. Within a hierachical data scheme, the administrator
might define more than one IP-address for each canonical name. To
implement such a feature in a relational database without breaking
the normalization rules, one would have to add another table.<br />
One of the most widely spread hierarchical database protocols is
LDAP. <b>ldap2dns</b> retrieves DNS information stored in an LDAP
directory service and generates a file suitable for
name-servers.<br />
Actually the most widely spread name-servers <a href="http://www.isc.org/products/BIND/">named</a> and <a href="http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/tinydns.html">tinydns</a> are supported.

<b>ldap2dns</b> specially has been designed to work with tinydns
and is the favored name server daemon for the author of this
program. <b>ldap2dns</b> can also generate files suitable for
<i>named</i> version 8, but this feature is not well supported.
There is a <a href="http://www.alternic.org/drafts/drafts-m-n/draft-miller-dns-ldap-schema-00.txt">
RFC</a> for a format description how to store DNS information in
LDAP. This paper a draft RFC which expired in February 1999, looks
as if it has been specially designed to be used by <i>named</i>.
This scheme does not have strict attribute-value-pair mapping,
making it difficult to be used by user interfaces. It also lacks of
an implementation (or I have never heard of any).<br />
Since <i>tinydns</i> is going another descriptive way. Therefore I
implemented a similar object-scheme more suitable for <i>tinydns</i>.

<h3>Installation</h3>
</noscript>
<ul>
<li>Install an LDAP server such as <a href="www.openldap.org">openldap</a>. Other LDAP implementations may
work but have not been tested. Also install the development
libraries and include files.</li>
<li>Install <a href="http://cr.yp.to/djbdns.html">djbdns</a> or if
you really have to, go with BIND.<br />
I suggest to install <i>tinydns</i> included in the <b>djbdns</b>

package, because it is safer, but You may have reasons why You want
to use BIND.</li>
<li>Install <b>ldap2dns</b><br />
Unpack the package and build it:
<pre>
$ gzcat ldap2dns.tar.gz | tar x
$ cd ldap2dns-version
$ make
$ make install
</pre>
Copy the file <i>ldap2dns.schema</i> into the directory
/etc/openldap/schema. Add the following
line to Your slapd.conf file:<br />
<pre>
include         /etc/openldap/schema/ldap2dns.schema
</pre>
Now restart your LDAP server.</li>
<br />
<i>Note: If you are running OpenLDAP 2.0 or earlier look for appropriate
schema files for your version in the <b>deprecated/</b> subdirectory.  These
files are known to work as of ldap2dns 0.3.5 but are no longer supported for future
feature updates.</i><br />
<br />
<li>Start to populate your LDAP server with DNS information. As a
first test do
<pre>
$ ldapadd -D "<i>binddn</i>" -w <i>password</i> &lt; example.ldif
</pre>
Replace 'myorg' and 'binddn' with whatever is appropriate on Your
system. Start a search and see if something was added
<pre>
$ ldapsearch -D "<i>binddn</i>" "objectclass=dnsrrset"
</pre></li>
<li>Test <b>ldap2dns</b>
<pre>
$ ./ldap2dns -D "<i>binddn</i>" [ -b "<i>searchbase</i>" ] [ -w <i>passwd</i> ] -o data -o db -L
</pre>
This should create a 'data' file, a 'corp.local.db' file and should
print the DNS content.<br />
Note: The <i>data</i> file is text data which can be processed with
<b>tinydns-data</b>. <i>corp.local.db</i> is the file as used by
<b>named</b>. If You are using bind, You also have to adopt the
file <i>/etc/named.conf</i> and You have to restart named.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Configuration</h3>
</noscript>
Two object-classes have been defined.
<em>DNSzone</em> stores all the information to define a DNS zone,
such as the SOA (Start Of Authority), serial numbers etc.
<em>DNSrrset</em> is used to store the information for a single
resource record, such as the domain name, IP-addresses, class and
type.<br />
Here are the tables:
<h4>DNSzone</h4>
This object-class represents a DNS zone. It is the container for
all the resource records within a zone. Zones can be primary or
secondary. If used in conjunction with <i>tinydns</i> zones are
always primary. Secondary zones don't make sense anyway! In
addition to being a container, the zone object has attributes
related to the management of the zone. These include the zone's SOA
information. Each zone-object can have none to many children of
class <b>DNSrrset</b>.<br />

<h3>Usage: Running ldap2dns</h3>
</noscript>
If You are a tinydns user, run <b>ldap2dns</b> in /services/tinydns/root.<br />
If You are an openldap user, the command line switches are the same as for ldapsearch
or ldapadd.
<pre>
$ ldap2dns -D "<I>binddn</I>" [ -w <I>passwd</I> ] -b "<I>searchbase</I>" \
-o data -e "cd /var/tinydns/root &amp;&amp; /usr/bin/tinydns-data"
</pre>
This generates a data file which is converted into a data.cdb by tinydns-data as
soon as ldap2dns detects a modification in the LDAP directory.
The password is required if You restrict read queries to authenticated users only.
Test with
<pre>
$ dnsq any corp.local <I>ipaddr</I>
</pre>
Replace <I>ipaddr</I> with whatever You configured tinydns to listen to.


If You are a BIND user, run <B>ldap2dns</B> in /var/named with
<pre>
$ ldap2dns -D "<I>binddn</I>" -w <I>passwd</I> -b "<I>searchbase</I>" \
-o db -e "kill -HUP `cat /var/run/named-pid`"
</pre>
Do not forget to add You primary definition to Your named.boot file.
Your named should be restarted automatically as soon as ldap2dns detects a modification
in the LDAP directory. If bind is not restarted, do so with
<pre>
# kill -HUP <I>PID</I>
</pre>
Now run
<pre>
$ nslookup - localhost
> ns1.corp.local
</pre>
Note that <B>nslookup</B> only works with <B>tinydns</B> if Your nameserver resolves its IP-address
backwards.

<script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript">

<noscript>
<h3>Usage: Running ldap2dnsd</h3>
</noscript>
When <b>ldap2dns</b> is invoked as <b>ldap2dnsd</b>, the program
starts as backgound-daemon and continuously checks for modifications in the LDAP directory.
If the the daemon sees a modification in the <b>DNSserial</b> numbers it updates the data
or .db files, depending what kind of output was configured. This check is done about once
a minute and is configurable.<br />
The command-line options for <b>ldap2dnsd</b> are the same as for <b>ldap2dns</b>.
Use the -u option to modify the update interval. You may also use -u on <b>ldap2dns</b>
to start as a foreground daemon. This is useful if You want to run <b>ldap2dns</b> from
<b><a href="http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html">daemontools</a></b>.<br />
<br />
These instructions assume you will be running <b>ldap2dns</b> under
<b>daemontools</b>b> and that tinydns is also running under
daemontools.  These instructions also assume you are using Dan Bernstein's
standard directory locations.  Make sure you change the below examples
to match your environment.<br />
<br />
Start by creating the a non-root user to run your ldap2dns and associated
logging mechanism:
<pre>
# groupadd -r ldap2dns
# useradd -r -d /dev/null -s /bin/false -c "ldap2dns Daemon" \
 -g ldap2dns ldap2dns
# groupadd -r l2dnslog
# useradd -r -d /dev/null -s /bin/false -c "ldap2dns Logger" \
 -g l2dnslog l2dnslog
</pre>
<br />
Next configure the ldap2dns area to be managed by <b>daemontools</b>.
Typically this is <i>/etc/ldap2dns</i>
<pre>
# cd /etc
# ldap2tinydns-conf ldap2dns l2dnslog /etc/ldap2dns /etc/tinydns/root
</pre>
The syntax is close to tinydns-conf except that you will also need to specify
the path to the <i>root</i> directory for tinydns.  This is the directory that
holds the <i>data</i> file.<br />
<br />
Next edit the file <i>/etc/ldap2dns/run</i> and optionally the environment
variables in <i>/etc/ldap2dns/env</i> as necessary for your environment.  This
may include configuring a base DN, a bind DN, a password, and an interval.<br />
<br />
When everything is ready configured properly create a symlink from
<i>/etc/ldap2dns</i> into <i>/service</i>.  This action will cause
<b>daemontools</b> to launch <b>ldap2dns</b>.
<pre>
# ln -s /etc/ldap2dns /service/ldap2dns
</pre>
After a few seconds <b>daemontools</b> starts <b>ldap2dnsd</b> which itself generates data
files whenever a modification is commited into the LDAP directory.

<b>ldap2dns</b> and <b>ldap2dnsd</b> recognize the following options:
<pre>
-D <i>binddn</i> specify the distinguished name to bind to the LDAP directory
-w <i>bindpasswd</i> use bindpasswd as password for simple authentication
-b <i>searchbase</i> use searchbase as starting point for search instead default
-o data generate a "data" file to be processed by tinydns-data
-o db for each zone generate a "&lt;zonename&gt;.db" file to be used by named
-L[<i>filename</i>] print output in LDIF format to [<i>filename</i>] or stdout for reimport
-h <i>host</i> specify the hostname of LDAP directory. Default is localhost
-p <i>port</i> portnumber to connect to LDAP directory. Defaults is 389
-v run in verbose mode
-vv even more verbose
-V print version and exit
-u <i>numsecs</i> update DNS data every numsecs.
</pre>
<b>ldap2dns</b> and <b>ldap2dnsd</b> recognizes the following environement
variables:<br />
<b>TINYDNSDIR</b>: Specifies the directory where ldap2dns writes its data
file.<br />
<b>LDAP2DNS_UPDATE</b>: Specifies the update intervall as the -u command line
option would.<br />
<b>LDAP2DNS_OUTPUT</b>: Specifies the default output, as the -o command line
option would.

<b>ldap2dns</b> and <b>ldap2dnsd</b> use the following parameters from
/etc/ldap.conf if not
specified on the command line:
<b>BASE</b>: The LDAP search base.<br />
<b>HOST</b>: The LDAP server.<br />
<b>PORT</b>: The LDAP port.
